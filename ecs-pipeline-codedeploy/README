This project simulates the CodePipeline deployment for ECS (no CodeDeploy is involved here) 

- As soon as there is a code change, pipeline is triggered 

- Code is built using CodeBuild and image is uploaded to ECR 

- Also "imagedefinitions.json" file is created as part of build and uploaded to S3 codepipeline bucket.
  And this file is used by codepipeline to identify the image and task information. 
   
- No CodeDeploy is used here 

- No EC2 is used
